<p>This extension integrates Burp Suite with SQLMap.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jython 2.7 (up to 2.7.2) DO NOT USE Jython 2.7.3, it has a bug that will cause the extension to fail</li>
    <li>Java 1.7 or later (the beta version of Jython 2.7 requires this). Note: Newer versions of Java do appear to work. Testing with jdk-11.0.7 works fine and newer versions are expected to work as well.</li>
	<li>A running instance of the SQLMap API server.</li>
</ul>

<p>SQLMap is embedded within the extension; it will be automatically configured, so you can click <i>Start API</i>.
In some cases you may need to manually adjust the configuration or run the SQLMap API manually.</p>

<p>Once the SQLMap API is running, you just need to right-click in the 'Request' 
sub tab of either the Target or Proxy main tabs and choose 'SQLiPy Scan' from 
the context menu.
This will populate the SQLMap Scanner tab with information about that request.  Clicking the 'Start Scan' button will execute a scan.</p>

<p>If the page is vulnerable to SQL injection, then these will be added to the Scanner Results tab.
